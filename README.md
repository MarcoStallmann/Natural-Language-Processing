## [Predicting the next word with Shakespeare Sonnets Dataset](https://github.com/MarcoStallmann/Natural-Language-Processing/tree/main/%5B4%5D%20Predicting%20the%20next%20word%20with%20Shakespeare%20Sonnets%20Dataset) 
For this assignment you will be using the [Shakespeare Sonnets Dataset](https://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/sonnets/sonnet_view.php?range=viewrange&sonnetrange1=1&sonnetrange2=154), which contains more than 2000 lines of text extracted from Shakespeare's sonnets. We will implement a model and train it, while also creating some helper functions to pre-process the data.

## [Exploring Overfitting in NLP with Sentiment140 dataset](http://help.sentiment140.com/home)
