## [Analyzing Machine Learning trends with NLP](https://github.com/MarcoStallmann/Natural-Language-Processing/blob/main/Analyzing%20Machine%20Learning%20trends%20with%20NLP/Analyzing%20Machine%20Learning%20trends%20with%20NLP.ipynb)

The Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (abbreviated as NeurIPS and formerly NIPS) is one of the most prestigious yearly events in the machine learning community. Its papers discuss a wide variety of topics, from neural networks to optimization methods and many more. We determine what type of data we can use for an NLP analysis and how it is structured. Each paper discusses a novel technique or improvement. 

 
## [Predicting the next word with Shakespeare Sonnets Dataset](https://github.com/MarcoStallmann/Natural-Language-Processing/tree/main/%5B4%5D%20Predicting%20the%20next%20word%20with%20Shakespeare%20Sonnets%20Dataset) 

For this assignment we use the [Shakespeare Sonnets Dataset](https://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/sonnets/sonnet_view.php?range=viewrange&sonnetrange1=1&sonnetrange2=154), which contains more than 2000 lines of text extracted from Shakespeare's sonnets. We will implement a model and train it, while also creating some helper functions to pre-process the data.


## [Exploring Overfitting in NLP with Sentiment140 dataset](http://help.sentiment140.com/home)

For this Notebook we will be using a variation of the Sentiment140 dataset, which contains 1.6 million tweets alongside their respective sentiment (0 for negative and 4 for positive).
